#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
int a = 500, b, c;
if (a >= 400)
b = 300;
c = 200;
cout << "value of b and c are respectively " << b << " and " << c;
return 0;
}


Ans: The output for the above code will be - 

    value of b and c are 300 and 200 respectively.

Because, The value of b is set to 300 and c is set to 200 WHEN the value of a
is greater or equal to 400. But the given value of a is 500. Hence, b and c will
will have the values 300 and 200 respectively.
